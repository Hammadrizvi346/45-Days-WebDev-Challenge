# 45-Days-WebDev-Challenge
45-day full stack web dev journey. I’m learning and building 5–6 hrs daily, covering HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Git, APIs &amp; more. Each day has its own folder with notes, code &amp; projects—showcasing hands-on practice, progress logs, and milestones in my path to becoming a full stack developer.
